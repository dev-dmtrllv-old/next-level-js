## About
### About the app 
The goal of this project/app is for users to better understand what kind of people they are and how they can better communicate and work together. The test consists of 18 pages with on each page 2 theorems. The user can everytime share 3 points between the theorems. So there are 4 possible answers (3-0, 2-1, 1-2, 0-3). The test takes a maximum of 20 minutes, and the users are not be able to ga back in the theorems. Finnaly the app shows the user what kind of person he/she is, it shows all the good points but also the points where the users can work on. Then, after the result, there is a option to see the good and bad points of the other types of persons and the users can save a pdf with their reuslt locally. This way they can better understand how to work with the other people and they can always look back at the saved results.

### Technical details
I choose to create the app with React and Typescript. React because I'm fairly familiar with it and typescript just to be type safe. I really like the intellisence that typescript provides. To build the app i will use webpack, awesome-typescript-loader to loader typescript files into webpack. I need to think if i will use a third party state management library (MobX).
